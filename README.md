# Locally-Refined-Graph-Neural-Network-(LRGNN)-data-and-codes

LRGNN is a graph neural network-based surrogate model designed specifically for irregular (non-uniform/unstructured) meshes.  
It serves as an efficient approximation surrogate to numerical simulations on complex geometries where regular grid-based surrogate methods are difficult to apply.

## ✨ Key Features

- Graph Neural Network architecture tailored for non-grid data
- Significantly faster inference compared to full-order numerical solvers
- Suitable for irregular surrogate modeling tasks (PDE prediction, physical field approximation, etc.)

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository provides the implementation of LRGNN, which aims to:

- Provide fast predictions on irregular grids
- Serve as a starting point for research and application in mesh-based surrogate modeling
